**Index was supposed to be an index of the website.**
Every website was *a document* in the early days. 

Today's websites are centered around *their product* and *its brand*. 
Today's websites are mostly apps: shops, display windows, entrances, 
customer support booths.

People don't read on the web â€” when there's nothing valuable to read. 
App-sites made us forget about websites that *are* the thing itself.
When I saw the web for the 1st time in 1998, most of it was pure content.

The world is changed. I taste [it in the water][atlantic]. 
But everything is not lost. 

Github Pages are today's Geocities.
