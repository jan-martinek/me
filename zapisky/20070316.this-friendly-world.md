<p class="odsazeny">In this friendly, friendly world<br>With each day so full of joy<br>Why should any heart be lonely</p>
<p class="odsazeny">
In this friendly, friendly world<br>With each night so full of dreams<br>Why should any heart be afraid</p>
<p class="odsazeny">
The world is such a wonderful place<br>To wander through<br>When you've got someone you love<br>To wander along with you</p>
<p class="odsazeny">
With the skies so full of stars<br>And the river so full of song<br>Every heart should be so thankful<br>Thankful for this friendly, friendly world</p>
