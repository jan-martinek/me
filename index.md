## *I am interested in&nbsp;understanding.*

I am a freelance designer, coder and teacher.  
I use technology to cope with problems.  
My background is in sociology, political science and media studies.

## These days

- I design *book-shaped text for tomorrow* with [Ivana Lukeš Rybanská][ivana].
- I work on a *good diagramming app* with [Lukáš Kubánek][lukas].
- I teach courses on sociology and *actual* computer basics at [Muni][muni].
- I develop *[Peer Blender][blender]*: a peer-assessment-based e-learning environment.
- In lead a [small team][demagogteam] developing a fact-checking platform *[Demagog2][demagogsrc]*.
- I design a CRM for novice fundraisers that should help them to start working methodically (coming public soon).
